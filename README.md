# Bike Sales Visualization

This project visualizes bike sales data using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, automating a process that is often done manually in Excel.  
The dataset comes from the `Bike_Sales_Visualizations_Lab.xlsx` file and contains sales and profit information across different years, countries, and age groups.

## 📊 Visualizations
1. **Line Chart** – Comparing annual profit vs. annual revenue
2. **Stacked Column Chart** – Product revenue by country
3. **Pie Chart** – Revenue distribution by age group
